description: |

  The main goal of this course is to discuss the analysis of
  multivariate experimental data based on the recently proposed
  multivariate covariance generalized linear models (McGLM) framework
  (Bonat and Jørgensen; 2016)1. This class of models can deal with
  multiple non-Gaussian response variables and can easily be adapted to
  deal with the most commons types of experimental designs, including
  multilevel and longitudinal designs and correlated responses. McGLMs
  can be seen as a extension of the MANOVA approach for the analysis of
  non-Gaussian data. We present the model specification along with
  strategies for model fitting and the associated R code.
