## Projects approved

## R packages

  * `EACS`: *Estatística Aplicada à Ciência do Solo*. This package
    contains documented datasets and reproducible data analysis from
    research in Soil Science. <br>**Main collaborators**: Milson Evaldo
    Serafim, Fábio Benedito Ono, among others. <br><http://leg.ufpr.br/~walmes/pacotes/EACS/>.
  * `RDASC`: *Reproducible Data Analysis from Scientitic
    Collaborations*. This packages contains documented datasets and
    reproducible data analysis from collaborations with researchers of
    many areas. <br>**Main collaborators**: Larissa May de Mio, Paulo
    Lichtemberg. <br><http://leg.ufpr.br/~walmes/pacotes/RDASC/>.
  * `gammacount`: A package (under development) for modelling dispersed
    count data. It contains functions to generate random numbers from
    the Gamma Count distribuition. The package also will provide
    functions to fit regression models.<br>**Project owner**: Eduardo
    Elias Ribeiro Jr.<br><https://github.com/jreduardo/gammacount>
  * `mcglm`: Multivariate covariance generalized linear models. `mcglm`
    fits multivariate covariance generalized linear models. It allows
    using a different linear predictor for each response variable of a
    multivariate response vector. The response variable can be continous
    or dicrete, like counts and binary and also limited continuos ou
    discrete/continuous inflated responses. The most important and
    relevant feature is that many covariance structures can be used to
    model the relations among variables.  <br>**Project owner**: Wagner
    Hugo Bonat.  <br><https://github.com/wbonat/mcglm>
  * `labestData`: Contains more than 450 fully documented datasets for
    learning and teaching of data analysis. These datasets came from
    books and were copied to the package as data frames with the
    correponding documentation provided in the book source.
    <br>**Project owner**: PET Estatística UFPR.

## Others

  * **Tikz**: it is my personal gallery of draws done with Tikz latex
    package.<br><https://github.com/walmes/Tikz>.
  * **electric-spacing**: Emacs package that enables smart operators (spaces
    are automatically inserted around operatons) for editing R files
    (`*.R`, `*.Rmd`, `*.Rnw`, etc).
